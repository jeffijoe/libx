## 1.0.0.alpha-1

## 1.0.0

## 0.3.0

- Added factory-based model API.
- Internal ID map for faster `get` lookups.

## 0.2.2

- Added `collection.forEach` and `collection.at`.

## 0.2.1

- Added `collection.move(fromIndex: number, toIndex: number)` which calls `items.move` on the inner Observable Array

## 0.2.0

- parsing a 3+ level deep parent->child->parent structure no longer results in duplicate models. This works by checking the collection _after parsing_ to see if a model with the same ID was added to the collection. If it was, parse the data _again_ but while _updating the existing model_. Refer to the README for an example.
